# FS22_ContractorMod
ContractorMod for Farming Simulator 22

This is a very first beta version with basic features of the mod already existing on previous FS version and few regressions described below.

Working as of May 19th:  
 - [x] Initialize new game with 4 characters near the map spawning location
 - [x] Save characters location/vehicle when saving game
 - [x] Load characters location/vehicle when loading game
 - [x] Switch between characters instead of between vehicles
 - [x] Enter some vehicles (basegame/mods) with several characters (4 + 1 vehicles configured)
 - [x] Hire/dismis worker for field/road task
 - [x] Leaving hired vehicle (with driver character) dismiss the job
 - [x] Compatibility with FollowMe mod
 - [x] Customizing/selling vehicle and returning hired vehicle with character inside
 - [x] Customizing character styles by editing ContractorMod.xml file in modSettings or savegame dir
 - [x] Change character name by using wardrobe screen
 - [x] First character should have selected player style when starting a new game instead of default style
 - [x] Using wardrobe to change each character style

Partially working:  
 - [x] Characters style can quickly mix up
 - [x] Several characters can get the same style after performing several enter/switch vehicle scenarios

Not working/known issues:  
 - [x] Changing character style by using wardrobe not only change current character but can also impact others
 - [x] Display characters not in a vehicle disabled for now (can crash the game quickly)
 - [ ] On foot characters can be shaking
 - [x] On foot characters not touching the ground
 - [ ] Display characters on map not implemented
 - [ ] Configure all basegame vehicles (+ some mods) to accept passengers
 - [ ] Compatibility with Courseplay mod not tested yet
 - [ ] Construction mode not tested yet
 - [ ] Train/horse not tested yet
 - [ ] Display other characters names like in MP game
 - [ ] Debug command to ease passenger positioning in vehicles


You can open issues based on your tests but please be the more precise possible so I can reproduce and understand it. You can inform if you find things working correctly that I did not tested yet.
Thanks for your support and help
